// 1395. Count Number of Teams

// There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

// You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

// Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
// A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
// Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

// Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).

// Solution 1 O(n^3) time | O(1) space
